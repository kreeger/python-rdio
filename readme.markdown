# python-rdio

## About

Another Python library for accessing the [Rdio API](http://developer.rdio.com/), using OAuth. Inspired by [Rdio's own 'rdio-python' library](http://github.com/rdio/rdio-python/) and [python-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/). This is more or less a test of my own abilities, as I've been writing [Django](http://djangoproject.com/) for a while, and I'd like to get into more Python-oriented development.

Function names and objects will follow Rdio's API specs for [methods](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/methods) and [object types](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/types) as closely as possible, accounting for Python-ish function and property names (underscores and all that, instead of camelCase).

## Installation

Don't sweat it. You can geek out and look at the source by cloning this git repo. But I doubt that's why you're here. Just do this!

    pip install python-rdio

What's that? You're not using `pip`? Shame, shame. I **guess** you can do this, too.

    easy_install python-rdio

Then, follow the usage example below. Please code responsibly. Everything is fully documented. That means you can use `__doc__` on each method.

## Requirements

 * [python 2.6 or higher](http://python.org/download/releases/) but not python 3.0
 * [oauth2](https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2)
 * [dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil)

## Usage

``` python
# Setup the API manager. If you have an ACCESS_KEY and ACCESS_SECRET for a
# particular user, you can pass that in as the third and forth arguments
# to Api().
import rdio
rdio_manager = rdio.Api(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
user = rdio_manager.find_user('benjaminkreeger@gmail.com')
print '%s %s's key is: %s.' % (user.first_name, user.last_name, user.key)

# Set authorization: get authorization URL, then pass back the PIN.
token_dict = rdio_manager.get_token_and_login_url()
print 'Authorize this application at: %s?oauth_token=%s' % (
    token_dict['login_url'], token_dict['oauth_token'])

token_secret = token_dict['oauth_token_secret']
oauth_verifier = raw_input('Enter the PIN / oAuth verifier: ').strip()
token = raw_input('Enter oauth_token parameter from URL: ').strip()
request_token = {"oauth_token":token, oauth_token_secret":token_secret}
authorization_dict = rdio_manager.authorize_with_verifier(oauth_verifier, request_token)

# Get back key and secret. rdio_manager is now authorized
# on the user's behalf.
print 'Access token key: %s' % authorization_dict['oauth_token']
print 'Access token secret: %s' % authorization_dict['oauth_token_secret']

# Make an authorized call.
current_user = rdio_manager.current_user()
print 'The full name of the current user is %s.' % (
    current_user.name,)

# Have some fun.
search_object = rdio_manager.search(
        query='Big Echo',
        types=['Albums',],
        extras=['trackKeys',])
album = search_object.results[0]
print "Found album %s by %s." % (album.name, album.artist_name,)
new_playlist = rdio_manager.create_playlist(
    name='Whoopie!',
    description='A test playlist for the Rdio API.',
    tracks=album.track_keys,
    extras=['trackKeys',])
print "Just made playlist %s with %i tracks at %s! Has tracks: " % (
        new_playlist.name,
        new_playlist.track_count,
        new_playlist.short_url)
tracks = rdio_manager.get(new_playlist.track_keys)
for t in tracks: print "%s (Duration: %i seconds)" % (t.name, t.duration.seconds,)
```

## Version history

Because you all care.

 * **Version 0.6**: Corrected a regular expression that refused four-character TLDs in emails.
 * **Version 0.5**: Fixed some bugs around the 0.4 release, including making `user.last_song_played` an actual `RdioTrack`. Also made duration a `timedelta`.
 * **Version 0.4**: Added object types for Rdio stations as documented [here](http://goo.gl/ActAB). Also added user lists for heavy rotation results.
 * **Version 0.3**: All calls implemented; most of them are working properly. Some minor tweaking may need to be done here and there, but a majority of the work is done. Also, setuptools!
 * **Version 0.2**: Supports PIN authorization through Rdio's oAuth implementation. Added `current_user` call.
 * **Version 0.1**: Initial release. Includes data models, unauthenticated API call logic, and one call.

## Disclaimer

I don't work for [Rdio](http://rdio.com/). I'm just a nerd who loves Rdio. If someone from Rdio has any sort of objections to this package, be it naming or whatever, please contact me at `benjaminkreeger [at] gmail [dot] com` and we can totally work it out.
